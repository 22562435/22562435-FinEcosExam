# Question 5: Volatility and Garch estimates

I have been asked to evaluate the following two statements

1.  The South African rand (ZAR) has over the past few years been one of
    the most volatile currencies

2.  The ZAR has generally performed well during periods where G10
    currency carry trades have been favourable and currency valuations
    relatively cheap. Globally, it has been one of the currencies that
    most benefit during periods where the Dollar is comparatively
    strong, indicating a risk-on sentiment.

The graph confirms that the South African Rand is highly volatile
compared to other major currencies.

The graph partially supports the second statment. It shows that ZAR
correlates positively with the Dollar (which suggests ZAR benefits in
certain global conditions) and responds inversely to volatility. This
indicates that ZAR may perform well during periods when global markets
favour risk-taking, but it may not be straightforwardly linked to the
Dollarâ€™s strength in all cases.
